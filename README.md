## Status Indicators

Each Claude Code session appears as a colored dot in your menu bar / system tray:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Blinking white | Claude is working |
| Blinking orange | Claude is thinking (prompt received, before tools run) |
| Blinking cyan | Subagent(s) running |
| Yellow | Waiting for your permission |
| Blinking periwinkle | Compacting the context window |
| Red | Tool error |
| Green | Done |
| Soft amber | Idle |
| Hollow ring | No active sessions |

Multiple sessions show as a grid of dots — see all your sessions at once. Click the icon for a popover with every session's status, model, and token usage.

## Features

### Session Monitoring
- **Real-time status** — polls every second, blink animation for active sessions
- **Multi-session support** — tracks up to 8 concurrent sessions as a dot grid
- **Subagent awareness** — tracks active subagent count per session, displays "Subagents(N)" badge with live count; parent sessions stay in subagent state while children are running (won't falsely drop to idle/error/waiting from subagent events)
- **Session dashboard** — detailed view with workspace, duration, model, git branch, tool usage, context usage bar
- **Token metrics** — incremental JSONL parsing for input/output/cache token counts per session, aggregated across parent and all subagents
- **Context usage bar** — color-coded progress bar (green → amber → red) showing token usage relative to model context limit (auto-detected: 1M for current models like Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 4.6, 200K for older models)
- **Running tool display** — fixed-width pill showing the currently executing tool and its target (file path, command, pattern) in real-time
- **Output speed** — tokens/sec badge calculated from output token deltas between poll intervals
- **Todo/task progress** — tracks TodoWrite and TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tools, shows completed/total counter with checkbox icon
- **Git status** — dirty indicator (`*`), ahead (`↑N`), behind (`↓N`) counts next to branch name, per-workspace with 10s cache
- **Config counts** — CLAUDE.md files, .mdc rules, MCP servers, and hooks counts shown in detail view, per-workspace with 30s cache
- **Rate limits** — 5-hour and 7-day usage progress bars with color coding (blue < 75%, purple 75–90%, red > 90%) and limit-reached warning
- **Provider detection** — shows "(Bedrock)" or "(Vertex)" next to model name when using non-API providers
- **System info** — RAM usage bar and Claude Code version displayed in the top bar
- **Agent team tracking** — expandable subagent view showing active and completed agents with token/tool breakdowns
- **Session revive** — ended sessions move to a revive section with elapsed timer and 3-click confirmation to resume

### Display Modes
- **Regular mode** — full metrics, tool chips, context bar, running tool, workspace path, git info, and signal string animations
- **Slim mode** (default) — hides metrics, tool chips, running tool, workspace path, and git info; keeps title, status, timer, context bar, and animations
- **Compact mode** — minimal cards with title and status only, auto-resizes window to fit content
- **(i) button** — toggle details on/off; highlighted when details are visible, grayed out in compact mode
- **Context display** — configurable context bar format: percent, token count, remaining, or both

### Permissions
- **Permission approval** — approve/deny Claude Code permissions directly from the dashboard via HTTP hook
- **Smart summaries** — human-readable tool descriptions ("Run: `npm install`", "Edit: `src/main.rs`")
- **Audit log** — every permission decision logged to JSONL with timestamp and tool details

### Animations
- **Signal strings** — audio-driven oscillating strings rendered behind card content using driven oscillator physics with FFT frequency data
- **Audio presets** — upload songs to extract frequency envelopes (bass/mids/treble) with playhead scrubbing and per-session offset randomization
- **Particles** — configurable pulse blobs traveling along strings with adjustable speed, spawn rate, spark count, and opacity
- **Piano key cards** — cards press down when working and pop up when idle, with configurable press/release speed
- **Title animations** — ripple, wave, pulse, glow, shimmer, bounce, shine, and more with per-character random timing
- **Vine border** — animated twisting vines around working/subagent cards
- **Effect presets** — bundled presets (Default, Neon, Ember, Ghost, Pulse, Minimal, Aurora)
- **Animation keyboard** — standalone window with buttons for triggering card animations (tap, wave, cascade, heartbeat, etc.)
- **Smooth transitions** — card background, border, shadow, and dot colors transition smoothly between states; signal strings fade out gradually (0.5s) when leaving working state

### Other
- **Auto theme detection** — follows system light/dark mode via Rust-side polling (works correctly in Tauri webviews where `matchMedia` doesn't)
- **CLI with full stats** — `--status --pretty` for SSH/tiling WM users, `--compact` for dense output, ANSI colors auto-detected
- **Native feel** — text selection disabled, fixed-width UI elements prevent layout jitter
- **Privacy-first** — shows only leaf directory names, full paths on hover only
- **Security-first** — no outbound network calls, atomic file writes, 0600 permissions, path sanitization
- **Session persistence** — sessions only close via SessionEnd hook, never by timeout (except error state after 10 min)
- **Non-interactive session filtering** — ignores `claude -p`, piped, and headless sessions via Claude Code's `session_type` field, `CORTEX_SUBPROCESS=1`, or `CUE_SKIP=1` env var
- **File locking** — concurrent hooks don't clobber each other's updates
- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, high contrast, reduced motion support

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed (the `~/.claude` directory must exist).
- **Python 3** on your `PATH` — Cue's hook is a small Python 3 script. Verify with `python3 --version` (macOS/Linux) or `python --version` (Windows).
- For building from source: **Node.js 18+** and the **Rust toolchain** (`rustup`).

### Install

Download the installer for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/avonbereghy/cue/releases/latest), or build from source (below). On first launch, the **onboarding wizard** installs the hook for you: it copies the bundled `cue-hook` script to `~/.claude/hooks/cue-hook` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` (your original settings are backed up once to `settings.json.bak`, preserved across reinstalls). No manual editing required — and no dependency on any pre-existing setup.

> **macOS — opening the app the first time.** Cue is a free, personal open-source project and its downloads are **not signed with an Apple Developer ID**, so on first launch macOS Gatekeeper will say Cue is "from an unidentified developer" or "cannot be opened." This is expected and only needs handling once — do any one of:
> - **Right-click** (or Control-click) **Cue** in Finder → **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog; or
> - open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find the "Cue was blocked" message near the bottom, and click **Open Anyway**; or
> - run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cue.app` in Terminal.

After setup, Cue appears as a normal app: a **Dock icon on macOS**, a **taskbar/Start-menu entry on Windows**, and an **application-launcher entry on Linux**, plus a status dot in the menu bar / system tray.

### Build from source — macOS

```bash
cd cue-desktop
npm install
npm run tauri build
cp -R src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Cue.app ~/Applications/
open ~/Applications/Cue.app
```

To start on login: toggle **Start at login** in Cue's settings, or **System Settings > General > Login Items > add "Cue"**.

### Windows & Linux

See [cue-desktop/INSTALL.md](cue-desktop/INSTALL.md) for MSI, NSIS, AppImage, and .deb instructions.

### Development

```bash
cd cue-desktop
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

## How It Works

Cue uses [Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to track session state. A Python hook script writes session status to a platform-specific `sessions.json` on every lifecycle event:

```
SessionStart       → idle
UserPromptSubmit   → thinking
PreToolUse         → working      (waiting, for AskUserQuestion / ExitPlanMode)
PostToolUse        → working
PermissionRequest  → waiting
PostToolUseFailure → error
StopFailure        → error
SubagentStart      → subagent
SubagentStop       → working/idle (when the last subagent finishes)
PreCompact         → compacting
PostCompact        → working
Stop               → idle
TaskCompleted      → done
Notification       → waiting      (permission / elicitation dialogs)
SessionEnd         → remove
```

The `waiting` and `done` states are refined by the Rust backend from the transcript (e.g. `waiting` is cleared once you answer, `done` is set on turn completion). The app reads `sessions.json` and renders the dot grid. Metrics are parsed incrementally from Claude's `.jsonl` conversation logs — only new bytes are read on each cycle, keeping CPU near 0%.

### Rate limits (optional statusline bridge)

Rate limit data is only available through Claude Code's statusline plugin protocol. To enable the rate limit bars, configure the `cue-statusline` bridge:

```bash
claude settings set statusLine.command /path/to/hooks/cue-statusline
```

The bridge reads JSON from Claude Code's stdin on each render cycle, extracts rate limit percentages, and writes `rate_limits.json` to the app data directory. Requires `jq` (falls back to Python if unavailable).

### Subagent state protection

The hook tracks an `activeSubagents` counter per session. While subagents are running (`activeSubagents > 0`), the parent session is locked to the "subagent" state:

- **working/waiting/error/done/idle** events from subagent activity are suppressed — the parent stays "subagent"
- The counter only resets when all subagents complete (via `SubagentStop` events decrementing to 0)
- The Rust backend won't downgrade a "subagent" session to "idle" due to inactivity while subagents are active

### Session lifecycle

Sessions are never pruned by timeout (except `error` state after 10 minutes). Only the `SessionEnd` hook removes a session. This means `done` sessions (waiting at the prompt for the next input) remain visible until the terminal is closed.

When a session disappears from the active list, it moves to the "Ended Sessions" section where it can be revived with a 3-click confirmation that opens a new terminal with `claude --resume <session_id>`.

## Permission Approval

The desktop app includes a localhost HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:3002`) that integrates with Claude Code's `PermissionRequest` hook. When Claude Code needs permission to run a tool, the request appears inline under the relevant session in the dashboard:

- **Smart summary** — "Run: `npm install`", "Read: `package.json`", "Edit: `src/main.rs`"
- **Expandable details** — full `tool_input` JSON for review
- **Approve / Deny buttons** — decision is sent back to Claude Code immediately
- **No auto-timeout** — requests stay pending until you explicitly decide
- **Audit log** — every decision is recorded to `permission-log.jsonl`

If the desktop app isn't running, Claude Code falls back to its normal terminal/VSCode permission flow.

## CLI Usage

Monitor sessions from the terminal — useful over SSH or on tiling window managers without a system tray.

```bash
# Rich multi-line output with all stats (colors auto-detected)
cue-desktop --status --pretty

# Dense single-line-per-session format
cue-desktop --status --pretty --compact

# JSON output for scripting (pipe to jq)
cue-desktop --status

# Show full workspace paths (leaf name only by default)
cue-desktop --status --pretty --show-paths
```

The CLI displays the same data as the GUI dashboard: session ID, messages, input/output tokens, tool breakdown, model, source client, cache hit %, context usage bar, git branch, and duration. Sessions are sorted with active states first (working/waiting/subagent), then idle, then done.

## Uninstall

1. In Cue: **Settings → Installation Status → Uninstall** strips the hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` automatically.
2. Remove the app (`rm -rf ~/Applications/Cue.app` on macOS; uninstall the MSI/`.deb` or delete the AppImage elsewhere).
3. Optionally delete the deployed hook script: `rm ~/.claude/hooks/cue-hook`.
4. If you enabled the rate-limit bridge, clear the `statusLine` setting too.

(You can also remove the hook entries by hand — search `~/.claude/settings.json` for `cue-hook`.)

## Security

- **No outbound network calls** — all data stays local, no telemetry, no HTTP clients. Localhost-only server (`127.0.0.1`) for hook communication
- **Atomic file writes** — temp file → fsync → rename prevents data corruption
- **File permissions** — 0600 on Unix for all data files
- **Path sanitization** — rejects `..` traversal, validates workspace paths
- **Hook validation** — rejects shell metacharacters in hook paths
- **Minimal capabilities** — Tauri frontend has no shell, HTTP, or filesystem access
- **DevTools disabled** — in release builds
- **Privacy** — workspace paths show leaf directory name only
